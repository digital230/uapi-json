    there were taracans, bugs. And the air conditioning didnt work also in the rooms.
    I think it would bee more than fair that your hotel would pay me back atleast half of the price we payd for.

The new card locking system means that too many clients slam their doors, which is a nuisance late at night. I was given assistance over a couple of matters  by the hotel manageress who dealt with these promptly and efficiently and with a smiling face, which always helps! At last I've found a London hotel with a decent-sized bathroom and comfortable bed. The somewhat basic continental breakfast is included in the room price; a cooked breakfast is available but seems expensive.The hotel is convenient for buses, tube and railways and there is a good variety of shops in nearby Noting Hill.</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="2916916" Date="2008-07-23" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="HS">Value for money I stayed at the hotel with a friend in a twin room for 2 nights. We booked this hotel as it was reasonably cheap - we wanted to take in as many attractions as possible and therefore did not want to spend too much on the hotel as we would not be there often. The reception staff were helpful and were happy to take our bags before check-in, however some of the other hotel staff were not so keen to help. Our room was an average size, however the bathroom was quite compact. It was very clean and cleaned well each day by the cleaning staff. Unfortunately, the room let itself down by having one faulty plug socket and one which was smashed - leaving a half open live socket. The bathroom door did not shut properly as it simply slid across and there was no lock on the door. It was also very noisy throughoutthe stay (from both guests and outside), particularly on a night time with many of the guests not respecting the fact that some people may be sleeping! Overall it is fair to say we got what we paid for - the room was clean, tidy and a good price but far from luxury! It was in a very good location (right near a tube station and a stride away from Hyde Park)and it took no more than 15 minutes to get to the main attractions of London! I would recommend this hotel for anyone with a similar siutation as we had as it is ideal for the price to leave you with plenty of money to see the sights.</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="698525" Date="2007-12-28" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="BK">+Near underground, quiet area, rooms not too small.

The room and hotel are okay and the location is very good in a nice area and pretty close to most things, including the carnival. However, the staff takes all the positives away. Receptionist never even said good evening on my arrival, but chatted to her workmate in their native language all the while. The concierge is down right rude, even heard him shouting at guest to move from around the desk as a TV is in the lounge. Maids stood outside my room every morning chatting loudly and swearing, and seem pretty annoyed that I was a late mover. As if it could not get any worst, I call the front desk on two different nights because there was smoke fumes in my room. First night the duty manager behaved as if I was insane and finally on my last night, it was revealed that guest in another room was indeed smoking. Where were the smoke detectors?

    The hotel was in a great location and very clean and comfortable. the continental breakfast left a lot to be desired...bread and more bread, watered-down juice, and coffee. No fruit or yogurt. We ended up buying peanutbutter at a local shop and that really helped. But for the price and location and cleanliness definitely a good deal!

    Traveler's tip on saving a few bucks
    Buy the oyster card for traveling in the Tube...if you are staying for several days. You can add more money to it as needed. And it saves by giving you the best fare for each ride and capping the days cost at 6 pounds, I believe.</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="698499" Date="2007-12-02" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="BK">+Relaxed atmosphere.

    This hotel is well run and maintained. The room was nicely decorated- modest but very comfortable. This was a delightful, hassle-free stay and the perfect place to come home after a day of sightseeing. The self-serve continental breakfast was a real plus. This hotel is conveniently located near buses on Bayswater and two underground stops, Queensway and Bayswater. Being a single traveler, I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel seemed to cater to the whole spectrum of travelers: young, old, single and family.

    Traveler's tip on saving a few bucks
    Besides the continental breakfast included, there are kettles in the room and refrigerators that can be stocked with food from the many late-nite stores on Queensway which sell tasty prepackage foods that can supplement the more expensive restaurant meals.</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="3178081" Date="2007-07-22" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="YH">The hotel was located near Kensington Palace and across the street fom Hyde Park. The tube and 2 bus stops are 2 blocks from the hotel and are quite convienient. London is huge and I made the mistake of thinking it was a lot smaller but I was wrong. You can expect a lot of walking to all attractions. There are a handful of attractions that are within walking distance to one another the rest are far from each other. The London Eye is across the bridge from West Minster Abby and Big Ben/ Parliment and those are really the only ones that are near each other. Prince Charles house is near Buckingham Palace, it is the big yellow place on the right just before the Queens garden and Buckingham Palace and if you go out back of his home you can get close up pictures of the guards, you can actually take your picture with them. It is not easy to get close up pictures of the changing of the guards so this is a good place to get one with yourself in it. The tube is the easiest way to get around to attractions if you are limited on time because it takes buses soooooo long to get through the heavy traffic. Piccadilly Circus was fabulous(theater district) and Oxford street for serious shopping reasonably priced and cheap food chains. As far as this hotel, it was fine. The lobby is clean and the lounge is brand new but the rooms are small but adequate and quaint although on my last morning their I saw a huge cockroach in the bathroom. The hallways are shocking. The rugs are filthy and have duck tape on them in some areas. Also be prepared for long waits at the airports to go through customs and to pick up you bags. We waited for 1 and half hours and this was 2 planefuls of people. I bought the Lodon Pass for the attractions and the Travel Pass for unlimited transportaion on the bus, tube and metro. I loved the travel pass and it was well worth the money. What i paid for thr travel pass for 2 days I spent on 5 taxi rides in a day. The attractions pass was not worth the money because most stuff is free to get into or it is not covered by the pass. This was my first time to London and it was great. get a good street map and you will do fine with getting around.</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="698461" Date="2007-08-23" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="BK">+The helpful and friendly staff in the lounge</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="698492" Date="2007-11-26" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="BK">+Close to the centre and to underground

    Central Park Hotel is a great place for the budget traveler.

My room was clean and comfortably large. The shower was easy to work, and I had plenty of towels. The concierge was very helpful in arranging tours. Also, the hotel was in a great location, across the street from Hyde Park and a short walk from the Queensway and the Queensway tube station. My only criticism is regarding the breakfast, not that great. But there are plenty of cafes on Queensway. Boots and Tesco stores are also nearby.

I walked circles for about a mile before locals could direct me better.
    *  Front desk was fine and courteous.  They spoke English well.  Not sure what others were referring to in other comments.
    *  I had to call a couple times to get my lock open and my refrigerator fixed and NEVER receveid a response.
    *  The lady in the breakfast area was as rude as someone can be.  I sat down when I arrived in the room and the lady first of all made me put back eggs that I put on my plate (as it's not included in the breakfast) as there was no sign what you are allowed to take and what you are not.  Then she asked me to move to another area by stating "this area is for lunch.  You saw me setting it up and you sat here anyway".  Like somehow I'm supposed to know which area was designated breakfast and which was for lunch.  What a joke.  The breakfast you were allowed was toast, bread and cereal.  There was nothing else like fruit.
    *  The room was pleasant, but small as expected.  The walls are quite thin so you can hear others next to you.  There is no A/C but I didn't particularly need it.
    *  Basically it's a place to stay when you are touring London.  It's close to the big red bus tour.

    initially we were presented with a failry contemporary facade, illuminated with fancy lighting, reception area also seemed nice and clean etc. checked in fine, although the person who checked us in had no real concept of the english language. but check in was fairly painless once wed waited in the queue for 20 minutes.
    so, we picked up our bags and made our way to the elevator, doors opened and we got in to what was not much bigger than a dumb waiter!! and not entirely fitted out any better!! up to the second floor and "ding"...............................nothing. then the elevator returned us to the ground floor, pressed the button again for the 2nd floor and "ding"..........................................nothing, doors wouldnt open on the 2nd floor. great. so the stairs it was. great after a 20 minute wait in the queue at reception!!!
    into the 2nd floor lobby, we were greeted by paisley carpets, which did well to hide the wear and filth and wall lines with oak/beech effect melamine that has seen better days!!
    to the room we inserted our entry card and presto IT WORKED!!! wow, i thought, this could be the turning point for the hotel. opened the door to find the bed (apparently a double but obviously a 3/4) only 2 feet away from the door.
    the room was pretty outdated, wallpaper was disgusting and most pieces were hanging off the wall. the tea making facilities were actually 2 tea bags, a coffee a kettle and 2 cups. no sugar or milk. upon filling up the kettle i found the remaind of the dover cliffs at the bottom!! there was more lime scale settled at the bottom than id ever seen before, however this was only bettered by the mould in the lid!!
    The room did however have a fridge! however no matter what setting it was always warmer in the fridge than the room.
    curtains had mould at the bottoms of the and the windows had pints of condensation on them!!
    bed was comfy although a bed of nails did seem more appealling than the loose springs that seemed to find there ways into my ribs no matter what position i led in!
    onto the bathroom.....totally tiled, was fairly clean apart from all the rust on the appliances. there literally was no room to put any of your toiletries.
    the floors and walls are waffer thin. so much so if someone is putting a plug in the room next door, it sounds like theyre coming through the wall!! you can hear with great detail people in the toilets either side, below and above you!!
    the conceirge who looked a bit like mr miagy from karate kid, was pretty abrupt and if you asked for a taxi, several minutes later you would get the most dodgey car turn up and charge you over inflated rates no matter where you wanted to go! we took a black cab on the way from the station to the hotel and it was 4 quid, to one of the hotels "limo service cars" (a clapped out megane) and were initially charged 18 quid!!!
    this hotel is really quite pathetic! if you look at their website you think youre getting something close to a travel lodge, but in reality travel lodges blow this out of the water!! its in dire need ove a massive overhaul. the pictures on their website seriously misrepresent what you end up with!!
    Stay clear of this or alternatively take your tent and sleep in hyde park for a more comfortable night!!</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="698515" Date="2007-12-17" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="BK">+Price was amazing &amp; the hotel very convenient for the Albert Hall which was where we were going</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="698481" Date="2007-11-11" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="BK">+easy communication to central London</hotel:Comments><hotel:Comments CommentId="698550" Date="2008-02-14" CommenterLanguage="EN" Source="BK">+central location and near to tube

So cost wise very good value &#163;60 to see Billy Elliott and stay in the central park.
    Very near two tube stations, just around the corner.
    Very good check in, and the rooms are on the small size, but didnt worry us, we had twin beds. The rooms are nice and warm, and you can turn the temperature to what you wish. Hot water for a bath/shower whenever you wish. Nice clean linen on the beds, and fresh towels, soap, shower cap etc in the bathroom. The road was quite noisey, but on a night time we never heard anything. One thing we didnt like is at 0100 our ajoining neighbours had the tv on loud and were chatting loudly, walls are very thin, shame they never thought about us! There were a few holes here and there, and our room was better than my daughters and family friend. Not a problem for us, as only staying the one night.
    As with everyone nearly that has taken the time to write on trip advisor, i agree the breakfast is a real let down. They state it is a continental breakfast, er, no way! A continental breakfast should consist of fruit, yogurts, cold meats, croisants etc. The fruit juice were in tiny glasses and very sweet and diluted, there were croisants and toast, cereal,+ thats it! Coffee and tea also supplied. Again as others have stated bacon, egg etc at a price, hardly anyone touched it, but there is a man that puts one rasher on your plate, he gives you your food! Look dry as well. Better to eat out, cheaper and edible.
    Everywhere was excessible from the central park, and i enjoyed our stay, if the manager were to bother to read what guests write on trip advisor, then maybe they would upgrade breakfasts for free, instead of doing the basic cereals etc, it was so cheap!!
    No bed bugs to report thank goodness.

I think I would if only because some of their employees are really nice, effecient and accomodating, however, next time I think I will talk to the Hotel manager if I encounter the same problems.</hotel:Comments></hotel:GuestReviews></hotel:HotelDetailsRsp></SOAP:Body></SOAP:Envelope>
